About
My name is Amanda Wycklendt. I grew up in Menomonee Falls, WI where I met my wonderful husband of three years. I attended UW-Madison majoring in Elementary Education. I am currently a 4th grade teacher for the Cambridge School District. I decided to obtain my Reading 316 license, because reading is a huge area of focus in my school district. I wanted to improve my skills for teaching reading in order to make myself the best teacher I can be. 
In addition to my love of teaching, I love to travel, cook, and bake in my spare time. My husband and I have had the opportunity to travel to Tahiti, various countries in Europe, Peru, and India. We are looking forward to our next trip which will be India. I am also a huge sports fan. I enjoy going to Brewer and Badger games.
