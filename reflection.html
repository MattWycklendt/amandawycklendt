<p>After completing all the course work for my Reading 316 License, I feel more knowledgeable in the area of teaching reading and am excited to integrate my new knowledge into my lessons. I have gathered many resources to keep in my classroom tool box in order to help my students succeed whether Iâ€™m a classroom teacher or reading teaching. The strategies and skills that I have learned will benefit all students. I will be able to correctly identify the reading deficiencies of my students and then implement interventions in order to decrease these deficiencies. I will also be able to create and implement a balanced reading program that includes a literacy element, vocabulary, weekly poems, writing, and either social studies or science. In addition, I will be able to be a resource for my district to help teachers analyze assessments and find appropriate interventions to use.</p>

<p>During the different courses, I was able to create a variety of lessons that I was able to implement in my everyday teaching. From these lessons, I was able to develop other well-balanced lessons that would help my students succeed. For example, after EDUC 640, I created anchor charts to display in my classroom. These benefitted my students, because they have been able to refer to them when they have questions about what we are learning. They allow them to take responsibility for their learning by seeking out the answers independently.</p>

<p>I especially found EDUC 529 & 683 to be particularly helpful. My school has implemented a school-wide intervention time each day. The assessments and interventions I learned during the class and practicum have helped me when planning interventions for my groups. I feel more knowledge and confident it what I should be teaching my students. I also feel that I am more able to deliver effective interventions due to the resources I was able to gather.</p>

<p>Overall, I found all the course work to be very rewarding. It was hard work, but I feel like a more competent teacher in the area of reading. The information and experiences that I have gained will benefit me, my students, and my colleagues.</p>
