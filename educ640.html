<h3>Artifact Description</h3>
<p>The artifact that I have chosen for EDUC 640 Balanced Literacy in the Reading Program is my American tall tales literacy unit. For my literacy unit, my students read American Tall Tales by Adrien Stoutenburg. While reading American Tall Tales, the students did a variety of activities to enhance their reading of the book. They identified hyperboles, similes, and metaphors in each chapter of American Tall Tales. They also learned about adjectives which boosted their own tall tales that they wrote. Lastly, they read A Lumberjack Story: A Chapter from the Great Lakes Past by Lynne Deur which taught the students about the lumber industry in Wisconsin. This artifact demonstrates my proficiency with Wisconsin Teacher Standards 4 along with InTASC Standards 1 and 6.</p>

<h3>Impact on Student Learning</h3>
<p>During this literacy unit, the students in my class learned the text features of tall tales and how to identify them in their reading. They also learned about adjectives. By learning about text features of tall tales and adjectives, the students were able to create their own tall tales. In addition, the students also learned about the history of the lumber industry. They were able to see the progression of the industry over time. My students were able to use the skill of applying knowledge they learned to create something of their own. They also were able to understand that things change over time. Both of these concepts will benefit my students in the future. They are ideas that will help them succeed.</p>

<h3>Professional Growth</h3>
<p>By creating my American tall tale literacy unit, I was able to make sure I had all the elements of a balanced reading program. Before creating this unit, I was not as organized with teaching these elements on a daily basis. This unit forced me to have a literacy element, vocabulary, grammar, weekly poem, writing, and social studies each day. Having all of the things implemented on a daily basis was very beneficial to my students. They were able to become better readers, writers,
and thinkers. </p>
<p>Another thing I took away from creating the literacy unit was the power of anchor charts. Prior to teaching this unit, I did not display many anchor charts regarding what I was teaching and what the students were learning in my classroom. By displaying the anchor charts, my students were constantly able to refer to them when they had questions. The charts gave them more independence during their work time. After seeing their impact on my students learning, I plan to create
anchor charts for each unit I teach. </p>

<h3>Application of Standards</h3>
<blockquote>
Wisconsin Standard 4: The teacher understands and uses a variety of instructional strategies, including the use of technology, to encourage children’s development of critical thinking, problem solving and performance skills.
</blockquote>
<p>While teaching this unit, I used a variety of instructional strategies to teach my students. We did whole group readings of American Tall Tales. The students were also able to practice their fluency while reading a poem. In addition, when learning about adjectives, they watched a Grammarapolis video, read a book about adjectives, and played a review game on the Smart Board. Lastly, while learning about the lumber industry, they played a game and read a news script. Both taught them about the lumber industry.</p>
<blockquote>
Viterbo Standard 1: The teacher understands how learners grow and develop, recognizing that patterns of learning and development vary individually within and across the cognitive, linguistic, social, emotional, and physical areas, and designs and implements developmentally appropriate and challenging learning experiences.
</blockquote>
<p>During the literacy unit, I implemented appropriate learning experiences to meet the needs of all my students. Each activity allowed the students to contribute at the level they were at. For example, they students had a graphic organizer to fill out before writing their tall tale. This helped my struggling writings come up with ideas, and it helped my advanced writers expand on their ideas. We also did whole group readings of American Tall Tales. By doing this, all students had the opportunity to hear a fluent reader reading with proper expression and pace.</p>
<blockquote>
Viterbo Standard 6: The teacher understands and uses multiple methods of assessment to engage learners in their own growth, to monitor learner progress, and to guide the teacher’s and learner’s decision making.
</blockquote>
<p>I had the opportunity to assess my students in a variety of ways during this unit. One way I assessed my students was on their ability to identify hyperboles, similes, and metaphors in each chapter of American Tall Tale. This allowed me to recognize which students understood the figurative language and which ones needed more instruction on it. I was also able to assess my students’ prewriting using their tall tale graphic organizers, their rough copies of their tall tale writings, and their final copies of their tall tale writings. These assessments allowed me to see my students’ progress through the writing stages. I was able to see which stages the students struggled with and need more practice with.</p>
